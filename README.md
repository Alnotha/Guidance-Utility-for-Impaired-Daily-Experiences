# Guidance Utility for Impaired Daily Experiences (GUIDE)

## Description
GUIDE is an innovative walking stick for the visually impaired. Through obstacle detection using a LiDAR, depth camera, and Python algorithms, GUIDE alerts users via haptic vibrations when obstacles are detected within 2 meters. It features two main adaptations of the conventional white walking stick: a redesigned handle that houses most of the electronics and an angle-adjustable sensor mount that holds the electronic sensors. This document describes the layout of our final deliverables.

## Design
The **Design** folder is organized into three main sections: **Hardware**, **Software**, and **3D Modeling**.

### Hardware
This folder contains all the data sheets for the electrical components of GUIDE, as well as system-level diagrams and wiring diagrams of our final prototype.

### Software
This folder contains all the software used in the final design of GUIDE and all code used for testing. The software is available in the zip folder and includes system-level diagrams for the software.

### 3D Modeling
This folder contains images and Autodesk Fusion files of all our 3D-printed parts implemented into GUIDE.

## Media
The **Media** folder is divided into two sections:

### Photos
This folder contains images of the final GUIDE prototype, highlighting each view and component. It also includes a PDF version of the team poster used for the CSCE Capstone Expo.

### Videos
This folder contains demo videos taken throughout the development stage of GUIDE. These videos showcase the initial testing of our sensors as well as footage of the team testing the final prototype both indoors and outdoors.

## Reports
The **Reports** folder contains all documentation produced at each stage of our capstone project, including:

### Proposal
- Problem Statement
- Proposal Report
- Proposal Presentation

### CDR
A report on the current development of GUIDE, including updates to the proposed design and system-level integration details. The presentation version of this report is also included.

### Final Documents
Contains the final report focusing on the implementation details of GUIDE and what was completed this semester. Additional documentation, such as user manuals, experimental results, and analysis, is also included. The final presentation is available in this folder.

### Weekly Reports
This folder contains all major accomplishments, plans, and notes for each week during the project. Initially, team members documented their own agendas; later, meeting notes were recorded in the specified format once meetings with the professor began.

## Team Notebooks
This folder contains PDF versions of all team members' individual capstone notebooks.
